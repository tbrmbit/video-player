    One of the first steps to restoring your credit score is to obtain a copy
    of your credit report and review it for errors.
    Disputing any inaccuracies can quickly improve your score. Additionally,
    making timely payments and reducing your credit card balances
    can have a significant impact. It's also beneficial to avoid opening new
    lines of credit while you're working on improving your score.
